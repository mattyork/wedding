    <h1 id="expecations">What to Expect</h1>
    <p>
      NatureBridge is a kids camp, and we hope to keep that summer camp feeling. There are fire
      pits, fields, an amphitheater, hiking trails, and canoes. Bring your toys. Expect to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll be spending a lot of time outside. Along with your fancy wedding clothes, bring a swimsuit,
      rain gear, and clothes to get dirty in.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will keep this website up to date, and we will also email you with updates or additional information.
      As the wedding gets closer we will be more specific about the schedule.

    <p>
      You can stay at a cabin on site at no charge. The cabins are fairly rustic - think summer camp. They have twin size bunk
      beds with camp mattresses, and most rooms also have one double bed. Beds come with linens (sheets and comforter), though
      you should bring your own pillow. Each cabin has a communal bathroom with multiple stalls and showers. All cabins have
      electricity. We're staying on site, and we hope you do, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      If rustic isn't your thing, AirBnB has many listings in the area. You may also be able to snag a room at the
      <a href="http://www.olympicnationalparks.com/lodging/lake-crescent-lodge/">Lake Crescent Lodge</a>, a quarter mile
      from the venue. The website may say they are booked, but they have soom rooms that they save for over-the-phone reservations.
      Try calling.
